All about Data Repository :-
       A data repository is a 
centralized place to store and 
maintain data.A repository can 
consist of one or more databases
or files which can be distributed
over a network. Data repositories
are often managed by data curation
personnel who ensure that files are
managed and preserved for the long-term.
     In software development,a
repository is a central file
storage location. It is used by
version control systems to store
multiple versions of files. While
a repository can be configured on
a local machine for a single user,
it is often stored on a server,
which can be accessed by multiple users.
